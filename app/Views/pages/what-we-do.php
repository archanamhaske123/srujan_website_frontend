        <h2>Incubation Services</h2>
        <p>At the heart of an EDIC is its incubation program. This program offers a range of services and support
          mechanisms tailored to meet the specific needs of early-stage start-ups. These services may include physical
          workspace, access to infrastructure and equipment, business advisory and mentorship, legal and financial
          guidance, and access to funding opportunities. The incubation process helps entrepreneurs validate their
          ideas, develop viable business models, and accelerate their growth trajectory.</p>
